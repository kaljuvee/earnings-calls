# $AAPL Q3 2024 earnings: Record June quarter revenue of $94B (+10% YoY), driven by strong iPhone (up 13%), Mac (up 15%), and Services (up 13%) growth amid rising tariff headwinds

Apple reported a robust Q3 2025 with revenue and EPS surpassing expectations, reaching all-time June quarter highs. The company’s diversified product portfolio showed broad-based strength, led by double-digit growth in iPhone, Mac, and Services. Despite tariff-related cost pressures, gross margins remained healthy, while operating expenses grew moderately. Management highlighted significant investments in AI and U.S. manufacturing, alongside optimistic guidance for mid- to high single-digit revenue growth in Q4, reflecting confidence in demand and innovation.

## 🐂 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝘂𝗹𝗹 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲

Apple posted a record $94 billion in revenue for the June quarter, up 10% year-over-year, marking a strong rebound and acceleration in growth across virtually all product lines and geographies. iPhone revenue rose 13% to $44.6 billion, driven by the popular iPhone 16 family, which outperformed the prior generation with broad global adoption, including double-digit growth in emerging markets like India and Brazil. Mac revenue grew 15% to $8 billion, powered by demand for the M4 MacBook Air and Mac mini, with new all-time highs in installed base and upgrader records. Services reached an all-time quarterly high of $27.4 billion, up 13%, fueled by strong Apple TV+ content momentum, Apple Music’s 10-year anniversary initiatives, and accelerating growth in cloud and App Store categories. The installed base across all categories hit new records, underpinning future upgrade cycles and Services monetization.

Despite a challenging macro environment and tariff headwinds, Apple maintained a strong gross margin of 46.5%, at the high end of guidance, supported by a higher-margin Services segment (75.6% gross margin) and ongoing cost discipline. Operating expenses rose 8% to $15.5 billion, reflecting increased investments in AI and infrastructure, signaling Apple’s commitment to innovation and long-term growth. Capital expenditure is increasing notably, largely driven by AI-related investments in private cloud compute and data center expansion, positioning Apple well to leverage AI capabilities across its ecosystem.

Strategically, Apple’s AI integration is a major growth driver, with 20+ Apple Intelligence features already launched and more personalized Siri capabilities expected next year. The company is embedding AI deeply into hardware and software, capitalizing on its Apple silicon advantage for on-device AI processing with privacy emphasis. Geographic expansion remains strong with June quarter revenue records in 25+ countries, including new retail store launches in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and India, and significant growth in Greater China (+4% QoQ) despite subsidies and tariffs. Apple’s $500 billion U.S. investment plan over 4 years further enhances its supply chain resilience and innovation capacity while addressing tariff-related cost pressures.

## 🐻 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲

Margin compression due to tariffs remains a critical headwind, with $800 million in tariff costs this quarter and an estimated $1.1 billion in Q4 assuming current policies persist. Products gross margin declined 140 basis points sequentially, driven by tariff impact and product mix, partially offset by cost savings. The tariff situation is fluid, creating uncertainty around future cost structures and pricing strategies, and the potential for tariffs to increase or expand to other regions remains a risk.

Growth in iPad (-8%) and Wearables, Home and Accessories (-9%) revenue was negative year-over-year, reflecting difficult compares from last year’s product launches and weaker demand. The iPad segment’s decline highlights challenges in sustaining growth outside of flagship product cycles. Wearables saw a similar decline despite Apple Watch’s all-time high installed base, signaling potential saturation or competitive pressures in the category.

While Services grew strongly, the company noted the potential risks from legal and regulatory scrutiny—such as ongoing litigation around App Store policies (Epic case) and the reliance on Google for search revenue. Apple is cautious about how these factors could affect Services profitability and growth, especially if revenue-sharing agreements change or new requirements are imposed. Guidance for Q4 anticipates a deceleration to mid- to high single-digit revenue growth, partly due to tough comps from last year’s iPad launches and the tariff-related pull-ahead effects that boosted Q3 demand by about 1 percentage point.

Execution risks include navigating supply chain complexities amid tariffs and geopolitical tensions, effectively scaling AI investments to deliver differentiated products, and sustaining product innovation momentum in a highly competitive environment. Additionally, Apple’s heavy reliance on flagship products like the iPhone 16 means any unexpected demand softness or competitive disruption could materially impact results.

## ⚖️ 𝗩𝗲𝗿𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁

Apple’s Q3 results reinforce its position as a dominant innovator with resilient demand and a growing services ecosystem that supports recurring revenue and high margins. The bull case is compelling given strong product momentum, expanding installed bases, and aggressive AI and U.S. manufacturing investments that enhance long-term competitive moats. The robust Services growth and record upgrader rates across multiple product lines demonstrate healthy customer loyalty and monetization potential.

However, tariff-related cost pressures and some product categories facing softness introduce near-term margin and growth risks. The cautious Q4 guidance and external regulatory uncertainties temper enthusiasm. Yet, these challenges appear manageable given Apple’s scale, pricing power, and strategic initiatives.

Overall, the positive growth trajectory and strategic investments outweigh near-term margin headwinds and external risks. The bear case would gain traction if tariffs escalate unexpectedly, AI investments fail to yield differentiated advantages, or competitive dynamics erode core product demand, particularly in iPhone and Services. Investors should monitor tariff developments, AI rollout progress, and Services regulatory outcomes closely.

🟢 **Accelerated AI Integration and Investment**: Apple is embedding AI features deeply into its platforms, with 20+ Apple Intelligence features launched and personalized Siri expected next year. AI investments are driving increased CapEx and R&D spend, focused on privacy-centric, device-embedded AI leveraging Apple silicon and private cloud infrastructure.

🟡 **Tariff-Related Cost Pressures**: Tariffs added approximately $800 million in costs this quarter and are expected to rise to $1.1 billion in Q4. While Apple is investing heavily in U.S. manufacturing and supply chain diversification, tariffs remain a near-term margin headwind and source of uncertainty.

🟡 **Mixed Product Category Performance**: Strong double-digit growth in iPhone (+13%) and Mac (+15%) contrasts with iPad (-8%) and Wearables (-9%) declines year-over-year. The negative comps stem from tough prior-year launches and accessories, suggesting some product cycle volatility and competitive pressures.
